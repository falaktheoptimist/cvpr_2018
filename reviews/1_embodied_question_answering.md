It has aspects of â€“ natural language understanding, object recognition, active perception, goal based navigation, logical reasoning, and linking language to corresponding actions.


## Strengths
Well defined AI task for small environment
Encompasses different aspects - language understanding, vision, RL, navigation
They have provided the data being used for training and models

## Weakness/ Notes
Has been done in a simulation environment only and navigation isn't as good as per their video. (https://embodiedqa.org/)
